<h2>Description</h2>

<p>
This is one of the simplest ways to make homemade whipped cream, without
the hassle of bringing out the mixer! All it takes is a few minutes and a willing arm.
</p>

<h2>
    Ingredients
</h2>

<ul>
    <li>
        Mason jar with lid (jar big enough to leave half empty)
    </li>
    <li>
       1/2 cup of heavy whipping cream
    </li>
    <li>
        Powdered sugar to taste (normal sugar works fine too!)
    </li>
    <li>
        1tsp vanilla paste or vanilla extract (optional)
    </li>
</ul>

<h2>
    Directions
</h2>

<ol>
    <li>
        Pour the ingredients into the mason jar and cover tight with lid
    </li>
    <li>
        Shake until you can't feel the liquid moving inside (about 3 minutes of constant motion)
    </li>
    <li>
        Open jar and check the texture. If the cream is too runny, keep shaking!*
    </li>
    <li>
        Once the desired texture is reached, serve and eat within the next 20 minutes.
    </li>
</ol>

<p>
    You can leave the whipped cream in the jar and shake periodically to keep the texture from softening.
</p>

<p>
    *Make sure you don't over-shake the cream! Doing so will turn the whipped cream into butter.
