<h2>Description</h2>
<p>This basil pesto is a new addition to our kitchen this year.</p>
<p>Until two months ago, I had never had pesto of any kind, though I had 
    been wanting to try it for years. I finally got around to make it and 
    I am now obsessed.</p>
<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
    <li>one container of fresh basil leaves</li>
    <li>one bag of pine nuts</li>
    <li>3/4 cup of olive oil (the better the quality the less you'll need)</li>
    <li>5 cloves of garlic, or to taste (this will add heat)</li>
    <li>salt to taste</li>
</ul>

<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
    <li>To a food processor, add all of the ingredients with half of the oil</li>
    <li>Blend the pesto and add oil accordingly, until desired consistency is 
        reached, thick like a paste or runny like a sauce</li>
    <li>Serve fresh and refrigerate leftovers in an airtight container 
        for up to three days </li>
</ol>
